### Groupie Tracker Visualisations Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to build upon [Groupie Tracker](https://github.com/abmutungi/01-founders-groupie-tracker) using Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design:

- Strive for consistency
- Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
- Offer informative feedback
- Design dialogue to yield closure
- Offer simple error handling
- Permit easy reversal of actions
- Support internal locus of control
- Reduce short-term memory load.

This project introduced me to :

- The basics of human-computer interface.
- The basics of CSS.
- Linking CSS and HTML.
